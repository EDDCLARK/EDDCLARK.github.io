<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is <a href="images/CV.pdf">**Yanbo Zhao (赵彦博)**</a>, a Master student supervised by <a href="https://cgst.cau.edu.cn/art/2021/1/20/art_49926_975651.html">Prof. Jie Wang</a> at China Agricultural University. My research interest includes the interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and environment under ongoing climate change and human activities, the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems carbon-water cycles to climate change. Although I mainly use the Remote sensing-based approach, I'm also into multiple methods including Earth System Models which I'd like to use in my future study.
